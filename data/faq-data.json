        "Question": "How does VideoBook work?",
        "Answer": "Recent research suggests that visual material significantly enhances retention and comprehension in learning. VideoBook automatically analyzes textbooks and retrieves the relevant videos for each page. The textbook and videos are presented together to enable students to simultaneously learn from the best videos and their prescribed textbooks. VideoBook allows the student to focus on the learning task rather than spend time and effort in searching and browsing for relevant videos."

        "Question": "How will this help my child?",
        "Answer": "STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education forms a core part of developing a child’s thinking abilities. A solid foundation in STEM will prepare your child for 21st century careers. VideoBook enhances STEM learning by allowing a child to have a deeper understanding of a subject by watching related videos (lectures, animations, demonstrations, experiments). Students spend more time on a textbook page since the learning experience is much richer and this engages them beyond class hours. VideoBook promotes practical understanding and creative thinking by presenting real life applications of the concepts learnt in class."
